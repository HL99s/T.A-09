#### How to Run

It contains following applications:

- main-app
- email-service (optional)
- report-service (optional)
- trend-service (optional)
- content-checker (optional)

Option 1 - run with manually started KeyCloak and ActiveMQ servers
- Run ```mvn clean install``` at root 
- Run ```docker-compose -f _config/docker-compose.yml up``` at root to start docker containers
- Go to main-app folder and run ```mvn``` to start the application

Option 2 - automatically start KeyCloak and ActiveMQ using TestContainer while application is starting
- Run ```mvn clean install``` at root 
- Go to main-app folder and run ```mvn -Pdev,withTestContainer``` to start the application

Option 3 - run from IDE
- import into your IDE and compile the full project and run the Application.java on main-app module
- Update run configuration to run maven goal `wro4j:run` Before Launch. It should be after 'Build'



Once the application starts, open  `http://localhost:8081` on your browser. The default username/passwords are listed on : gt.app.Application.initData, which are:

- system/pass
- user1/pass
- user2/pass
